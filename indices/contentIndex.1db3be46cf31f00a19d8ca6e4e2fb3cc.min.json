If you don’t like how things are done around here, I’ve got a suggestion for you.   \n  \nAsa: What?   \n  \nSamantha: File a complaint.   \n  \n**[end of dialogue]**\n\n## Details\n\nThe title of this episode is “Dealing with Unhappy Employees.” To “deal with” means to take care of a problem, to solve or resolve some sort of problem.   \n  \nAsa says, “I don’t know how we got stuck with reviewing employee complaints.” To “get stuck with (something)” is a phrasal verb meaning to be forced to do something that is boring or unpleasant, to have to do something you don’t want to do: “I cooked dinner and my wife got stuck with washing the dishes.” Asa is saying that he doesn’t know how they got stuck with “reviewing,” or looking at, employee complaints. A “complaint” is something negative that is said or written, and usually comes with an explanation about why someone doesn’t like something.   \n  \nAsa says, “This has got to be the worst job ever.” Samantha says, “This is important work, and somebody has to do it. Come on, let’s get started,” she says. Asa says, “I think it’s bad for morale to allow employees to file complaints.” “Morale” (morale) is the way that a group of people, especially employees, feel about their jobs (their opinions, what they think about their jobs). It’s the general feeling that they have. Morale can either be high or low. If you say, “My employees have low morale,” you mean they’re not very interested, they’re not very happy, they’re not very excited. The opposite would be high morale.   \n  \nAsa is saying that it’s bad for morale to have the employees “file,” or submit (give to the company) their complaints. He says, “We’re all overworked and underpaid, and most of us are burned out.” To be “overworked” means to have too much work and to work too hard, making you tired. We all think that we are overworked, I’m sure! To be “underpaid” means that you don’t get enough money for the work that you do. Once again, most people think that they are overworked and underpaid. This can cause some people to burn out. To “burn out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to become tired from having done too much of something for too long. So, if you continue to do the same thing year after year and it’s very difficult, you could eventually burn out; you could get to the point where you’re too tired to want to continue, that you’re no longer effective at what you do.   \n  \nSamantha says, “How else are disgruntled employees going to voice their grievances?” “Disgruntled” means unhappy, disappointed, perhaps even angry. “To voice” means to express something in words, to say something. “Voice,” like “burn out,” has different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations of both of those terms. Samantha is saying that she doesn’t know how these upset, angry, disgruntled employees are going to “voice their grievances,” are going to tell the company what they don’t like. A “grievance” is like a complaint that is said or written with an explanation. Often, it is related to people thinking that there is something unfair or that they haven’t been treated right by their company.   \n  \nAsa says, “Personally (in my opinion), I think it’s stupid for employees to put their complaints on paper.” “On paper” just means in writing, written down. “Aren’t they worried about retaliation from the management?” “Retaliation” means revenge, something that you do to hurt another person who has hurt you. So, if I punch you, you could retaliate and punch me back. Asa is saying that if the employees complain, the company could retaliate against them – could do something negative, something bad to them.   \n  \nSamantha says, “I don’t think that’s going to happen. The whole point (the main reason) of having this system is to resolve any problems before they get blown out of proportion.” To “resolve” means to solve, to fix or end a problem. So, they’re trying to fix any problems with the employees before they get blown out of proportion. *To “blow (something) out of proportion” means to make it more important or more serious than it really is or than it has to be.* So, you’re trying to stop the problems when they’re small, before they get too big.   \n  \nSamantha says, “It’s to everybody’s benefit to try to make this work.” Asa says, “On the contrary,” meaning I think it’s the exact opposite; I disagree with you. He says, “On the contrary, I think it makes for a dysfunctional workplace.” Asa is saying that he thinks it “makes for,” meaning it causes, a dysfunctional workplace. “Dysfunctional” means not functional; not working properly, especially when people have bad relationships with each other. There’s a popular expression you’ll read or hear about called “the dysfunctional family.” It would be a family that doesn’t communicate very well with each other, doesn’t have good relationships with each other. Asa says, “employees thinking of things to complain about and the management with their backs up against the wall.” Asa is saying this is why it causes a dysfunctional workplace, because the employees are thinking of things to complain about and the managers – the management has their backs up against the wall. “To have one’s back up against the wall” means to be in a position where you don’t have a lot of options or choices, that you’re forced to do something without necessarily having a lot of flexibility.   \n  \nAsa says, “I just don’t get it” – I don’t understand. Samantha says, “No, I guess you don’t (meaning no, you don’t understand). If you don’t like how things are done around here, I’ve got a suggestion for you.” Asa says, “What?” Samantha says, “File a complaint.” Of course, that’s what Asa was complaining about: employee complaints.   \n  \nNow let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.\n\n![mind map](Pasted%20image%2020220611213547.png)","lastmodified":"2022-06-26T23:07:19.500907513Z","tags":null},"/notes/ieslpod/A-Day-in-the-Life-of-Jeff/01-Getting-Up-Jeffs":{"title":"01 Getting Up - Jeff's","content":"# 01 Getting Up - Jeff's\n\n## GLOSSARY\nto get up – to get out of bed; to leave one’s bed   \n* This morning I got up very quickly because the baby was crying.   \n  \nto wake up – to awaken; to stop sleeping   \n* She always leaves her curtains open so that she can wake up with the sunlight.   \n  \nto handle – to manage; to deal with; to control   \n* Are you sure that you can handle taking six classes this semester?   \n  \ncovers – the layers of fabric that cover a bed; the cloth material that covers a bed and that keep one warm   \n* When my husband sleeps, he always steals the covers and then I get so cold at night!   \n  \ncomforter – the top-most, thickest cover for a bed, usually made of feathers or other warm material   \n* In the winter, they sleep under a very thick comforter, but in the summer they don’t use it.   \n  \nlight blanket – a thin cover for a bed, made of wool, cotton, or other material   \n* When Marcos saw Maria sleeping on the sofa, he covered her with a light blanket so she wouldn’t be too cold.   \n  \npillow – a soft cushion for one’s head in bed, usually filled with feathers, cotton, or other material   \n* Why do people decorate their beds with so many pillows?

My old **roommate** used to like the **terrible buzzer** that you find on most alarm clocks nowadays, which always used to **drive me nuts**.

Of course, when I’m staying in a hotel, it’s usually easier to just get **a wake up call** from the **hotel** than set the alarm.   \n  \nI’m not really an e**arly riser**, so I don’t jump out of bed ready to **take on the world**. I get up very **slowly**, usually **one foot on the floor at a time**. Every once in awhile I’ll oversleep, but not too often.
