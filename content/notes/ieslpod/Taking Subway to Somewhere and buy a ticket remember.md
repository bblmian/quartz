Misha: I’d like to buy a t**oken for the subway.** 

Clerk: The subway doesn’t use tokens anymore.  ^5133b8

Misha: Oh? I didn’t know that. It’s been a few years since I visited New York. How do I pay for the fare? 

Clerk: You can **buy a ticket for a single ride** that expires two hours after it’s issued. If you’re going to be here all week, I’d suggest getting a **seven-day card** that gives you **unlimited rides**. Otherwise, I’d recommend getting a **MetroCard**.  ^26831d

Misha: I’m only here for two days. How much is each ride? 

Clerk: It’s $2.00. If you buy a MetroCard worth more than $10.00, you **get a 20% discount**. So with a $10.00 card, you get six rides instead of five. The card allows you to **transfer to buses**, too. 

Misha: Okay. I’ll take a MetroCard worth $10.00. How is the money deducted from my card? 
Clerk: The **turnstile automatically deducts the fare** each time you go through it. Here’s your card.  ^ee24d2

Misha: Thanks, but I’m not sure which line to take to Queens. 

Clerk: Here’s a **subway map**. Follow the signs **to the platform of the train you want.** 
Misha: Okay, thanks.  ^0fb78a
