## STORY

I go into my **bathroom** sometime around 6:45 a.m. My **sink** and **medicine cabine**t are on the left when you enter my bathroom. The **toilet** is next to that, with the **tub** in front. Anyway, I turn on the lights, and try to find the **mouthwash** in the medicine cabinet. I pour a small amount into a cup, **swish it around** for 30 seconds, **gargle**, and **spit**. Not pleasant, but necessary. Then I get out the **floss**. When I’m done flossing, I pull out the **toothbrush** and the **toothpaste**. I brush and then it’s off to the **shower**.    
  
I pull the shower **curtain** aside, step into the **tub**, and pull the curtain back. I **turn on** both the hot and the cold water, looking for the **perfect temperature**. I l**ather up with** soap, put some shampoo in my hair, then **rinse and dry off**. Now it’s **shaving** time. I used to own an **electric razor**, but I found it didn’t **shave close enough**. So now I’m back to the old hand razor. I lather up with shaving cream, and I start to shave. I r**inse the razor** and throw the **disposable blades** in the **trash**. It’s about 7:00 AM, and I’m on to **breakfast**.
