## STORY

The worst part of the day for me is definitely when I have to get up. **Waking up**, that I can handle. But getting up? That, I hate. **The covers** I have on my bed   
are **heavy**, mostly because I have **a comforter as well as a light blanket**. I sleep with two pillows, which for some reason have different color pillowcases. Well, at least the sheets match.   
  
I sometimes wake up **before the alarm goes off**. I like to keep the alarm at **a low volume**, with some **classical music**, nothing too jarring. My old **roommate** used to like the **terrible buzzer** that you find on most alarm clocks nowadays, which always used to **drive me nuts**. As I was saying, I sometimes **wake up before the alarm**, usually because of some **noise outside the house**—a car **door slamming**, an **alarm going off**, **gunfire**—well, okay, not gunfire, but man, is my neighborhood noisy! Of course, when I’m staying in a hotel, it’s usually easier to just get **a wake up call** from the **hotel** than set the alarm.   
  
I’m not really an e**arly riser**, so I don’t jump out of bed ready to **take on the world**. I get up very **slowly**, usually **one foot on the floor at a time**. Every once in awhile I’ll oversleep, but not too often. I really love the weekends, when I can **sleep in**.
