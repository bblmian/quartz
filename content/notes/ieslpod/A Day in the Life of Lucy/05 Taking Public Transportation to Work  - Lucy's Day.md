Story
	I like my job but it **takes over an hour** to get there from my part of town. First, I walk three blocks to the **subway station** and swipe my **monthly pass** to get through the turnstile. I wait on the platform for the first express train. I get on and since it’s so crowded during the morning hours, there **aren’t any seats** and I stand, holding onto a handrail. At my stop, I get off and **transfer to a second train** that will get me to Union Station. This one isn’t as crowded and I **manage to find a seat**.   
	When the train gets to Union Station, I get off the train, go up the stairs, and go out of the front exit **to the bus stop**. I get on the B bus to downtown and **show my bus pass** to the bus driver. I sit down near the front of the bus and when three more people get on board, the driver starts on the route. When we get **close to my stop**, I **press the button** to signal to the driver that I need to get off and the bus **pulls up to the next stop**. I get off and **walk half a block** to the **building where I work**. It’s a long commute, but I look around every morning and I see that I’m not the only one who has to do it.

如果你乘坐地铁的话，地铁的票很有多重，最早的叫[token](notes/ieslpod/Taking%20Subway%20to%20Somewhere%20and%20buy%20a%20ticket%20remember.md#^5133b8)，现在已经不在使用了。地铁也有卡，我们所说的次卡就叫[ticket](notes/ieslpod/Taking%20Subway%20to%20Somewhere%20and%20buy%20a%20ticket%20remember.md#^26831d)一般就一次或者往返的卡票。或者可以买多日的卡叫[Seven-days Card](notes/ieslpod/Taking%20Subway%20to%20Somewhere%20and%20buy%20a%20ticket%20remember.md#^26831d)。当然，地铁也有月卡，我们不叫mothly card，而是直接叫[MetroCard](notes/ieslpod/Taking%20Subway%20to%20Somewhere%20and%20buy%20a%20ticket%20remember.md#^ee24d2)，即为地铁卡。
