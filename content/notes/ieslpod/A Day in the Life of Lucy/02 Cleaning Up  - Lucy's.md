## STORY
I share a **bathroom** with my **roommate**, which is usually not a problem. We each try to keep the **sink**, the **tub**, and the **toilet** clean, and we have **separate medicine cabinets** to keep our things. There’s also room under the sink for our **hairdryers** and **tampons**. 

I start out by **rinsing my mouth** with some mouthwash before **flossing**. Then, I take out my **toothbrush** and **toothpaste** and brush my teeth. I only **wash my hair** every other day so I **put on a shower cap** and don’t have to **get out my shampoo and conditione**r. I **like to take bubble baths** when I have time, but on a busy morning, a shower will have to do. I **lather up quickly** and **give my legs a quick shave**. 

I **don’t wear a lot of make-up** to work so I just **put on a little blush** **and a light-colored lipstick**, and **skip the mascara and eye shadow**. I put a few **hot curlers** in my hair and I’m ready for breakfast!

* Yesterday he gave his dog a bath in the tub.

* Please don’t flush the toilet while someone is taking a shower because it changes the water pressure.   
  
medicine cabinet – a small, flat cabinet on a bathroom wall that is used to store medicines, toothbrushes, lotions, and other things, and has a mirror on the front   
* His medicine cabinet is full of vitamins because he believes that taking vitamins is the best way to stay healthy.

* Many public bathrooms have a small machine that sells tampons for 25 cents.   
  
mouthwash – a liquid that cleans one’s mouth and makes breath smell better   
* Children need to be taught that they shouldn’t swallow mouthwash because it might make them sick.   
  
to floss – to moved a thick thread between one’s teeth to clean them   
* The dentist said that we should floss at least once a day to keep our teeth clean.   
  
shower cap – a piece of plastic with elastic that is worn over one’s head to keep one’s hair dry while taking a shower   
* She didn’t know that her shower cap had a small hole at the top and her hair accidentally got wet.   
  
shampoo – a liquid soap made for cleaning one’s hair   
* Martha uses a special shampoo that supposedly makes her hair grow faster.   
  
conditioner – a liquid that is put on after shampooing to make one’s hair soft and shiny   
* This conditioner makes my hair feel too oily. I’ll never buy this kind again.   
  
bubble bath – a bath in a tub full of warm water with many soap bubbles   
* After a long day at work, she took a bubble bath to relax.   
  
to lather up – to cover oneself with soap or shampoo

* Alex accidentally cut his neck while shaving this morning.

* Theresa put on too much of her mother’s blush and ended up looking like a clown.

* When she drank her coffee, most of her lipstick came off of her lips and stayed on the cup.

* Don’t cry! If your mascara gets wet, you will have black lines under your eyes.   
  
eye shadow – a colored powder put on a woman’s eyelid (the skin above one’s eye)   
* Blue eye shadow was very popular in the 1960’s, but now natural colors are more common.

* Could you please help me take these hot curlers out of my hair? I can’t reach the ones in the back.
