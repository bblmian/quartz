## STORY

On a weekday, I usually **get up** around 6:30 a.m., but I **set my alarm** to **go off** at 6:20 so that I can hit the **snooze button** to sleep another 10 minutes. My roommate thinks I’m crazy, but doing this in the mornings actually helps me wake up. I’m **a night owl**, not **an early bird** like she is, so I need an extra few minutes to **get going** in the morning. 

One reason it’s so hard to get up is because my bedroom and my bed are so comfortable. I **splurged** and bought a bed with a very soft, **thick mattress**. I also have matching **sheets** and **pillowcases**, and a **comforter** that is made of **goose down**. Even my nightstand matches my sheets and the rest of my bedroom. I decorated it so that it would be restful after a busy day at work. 

When I get up, **the first thing I do** is put on my **robe**. It’s always **so cold** in the apartment in the mornings, no matter what time of year it is. Then, I usually **make my bed**. I hated making my bed when I was little, but now it’s become a **routine**. Sometimes, though, I’m so tired that I **sleep in** for just a little too long and then, the bed definitely doesn’t get made. On those days, I wish I could sleep in all day! 

## Q&A
