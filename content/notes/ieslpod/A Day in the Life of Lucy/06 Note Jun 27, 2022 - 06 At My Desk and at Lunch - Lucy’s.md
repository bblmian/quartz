I get to the office and **sit down at my desk**. I share a **cubicle** with another employee, Jim, but he only works in the afternoons so we don’t usually get in each other’s way too much. I boot up my computer and look at my **agenda for today**. I had about 30 new emails in my inbox but I decide not to read them right away. There were some **new inter-office paperwork** in my inbox too, but I decide to look at them a little later. First, I wanted to start in **on a report** that I had to finish today. I had a conference call at the end of the day with the head office, but I had most of the day to get it done.  ^73f304

Before long, it was the lunch hour. I **didn’t pack a lunch** so I ask my supervisor if she wanted to have lunch together. We head down the street to **a sit-down restaurant**. The **hostess** shows us to a **table** in the back of the restaurant. The waiter arrives a few minutes later and we **order entrees**, no appetizers, since we need to get back by 1:00. The waiter was very busy so I had to wave him down to **get the check**. He brought the bill, and my supervisor and I **split the check**. We walk back to the office and I get back to work. Just four more hours until quitting time! 

"entree," is the main part of your meal, what we would call the main course.

And a [conference](#^73f304) call is also very common

Q &A 
1. What shall I do to have the bill (since the waiter always busy in the noon.)
2. Why I like to go out for lunch?
